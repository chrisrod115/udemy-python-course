# Week 2 Review

## Overview
This is my second week of my coding journey. I have completed most of the programming assignments this week and have learned a lot about functions debugging and also dictionaries. 

### Projects Completed

- **Highlights:** Implemented the Caesar Cipher for encryption and decryption, practicing algorithmic logic and string manipulation.

#### Day 9 - Secret Auction
- **URL:** [Secret Auction](https://github.com/chrisrod115/udemy-python-course/tree/main/100DaysOfCode/Day_9_SecretAuction)
- **Highlights:** Built a secret auction system, exploring concepts of user input handling and data structure manipulation in Python.

## Reflections
This week was a blend of creativity and logic. Each project pushed my boundaries and solidified my understanding of Python's capabilities. I particularly enjoyed the challenges that combined logical problem-solving with user interaction, as they provided a practical perspective on how Python can be used in real-world applications.

## Goals for Next Week
- Dive into more complex Python projects, possibly exploring data structures and algorithms.
- Start working with external libraries and frameworks to broaden my coding toolkit.
