# Weekly Review - November 26, 2023

## Overview
This week was a productive period in my learning journey, where I completed three projects. This was my first week on this 100 Day Python challenge. I have learned the following from completing these three projects. 

### Projects Completed

#### 1. Band Name Generator
- **URL:** [Band Name Generator](https://github.com/chrisrod115/udemy-python-course/tree/main/100DaysOfCode/Day_1_BandNameGenerator)
- **Objective:** To develop a user-friendly Python program that generates unique band names based on user input.
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - Gained proficiency in string manipulation and user input handling in Python.
  - Enhanced understanding of basic programming constructs like variables and data types.

#### 2. Tip Calculator
- **URL:** [Tip Calculator](https://github.com/chrisrod115/udemy-python-course/tree/main/100DaysOfCode/Day_2_TipCalculator)
- **Objective:** To create a program that calculates the total cost of a meal, including a tip, based on user input.
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - Improved skills in mathematical operations and precision handling in Python.
  - Learned to create interactive and user-friendly prompts.

#### 3. Treasure Island
- **URL:** [Treasure Island](https://github.com/chrisrod115/udemy-python-course/tree/main/100DaysOfCode/Day_3_TreasureIsland)
- **Objective:** To build an interactive text-based adventure game, enhancing decision-making and logical flow in a program.
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - Developed skills in creating complex conditional statements and managing program flow.
  - Enhanced creativity in problem-solving and storytelling within a programming context.

## Reflections
This week's projects were not only about learning Python syntax but also about understanding how to structure a program logically and make it user-friendly. Each project pushed me to think more critically about the code I write and its impact on the end-user. 

## Goals for Next Week
- Start working on more advanced Python projects.
- Focus on understanding and implementing data structures.
- Begin exploring external libraries and frameworks to enhance project functionalities.
- Continue with this format of updating my GitHub page to showcase my progress and motivate me to be consistent. 
- Look for other challenges to complete and provide more motivation. i.e blind 150
