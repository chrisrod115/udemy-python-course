#  100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my "100 Days of Code" challenge! In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress as I develop 100 different applications over 100 days, using Python. This challenge is guided by Angela Yu, a renowned online instructor from Udemy, known for her comprehensive and engaging teaching style. 

## ðŸ“š About the Challenge

The "100 Days of Code" challenge is a personal commitment to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. I've decided to focus on Python due to its versatility and widespread use in various fields like web development, data science, automation, and more. Each day, I'll be building a new application, starting from basic projects to more complex ones as I progress.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Goals

- **Consistency**: To code every day for 100 days.
- **Learning**: To deepen my understanding of Python and its applications.
- **Portfolio Building**: To create a diverse range of projects that can be added to my portfolio.
- **Community Engagement**: To connect with other learners and developers in the coding community.

## ðŸ—¼ Structure


The repository is organized into weekly folders, each containing the projects for that week. Each week's folder is named `Week_<number>`. Inside each weekly folder, the daily projects are stored in their own directories, named `Day_<number>_<ProjectName>`. Inside each daily directory, you'll find:

- Python script(s) for the day's project.
- A brief README file explaining the project, its functionality, and any special libraries used.
- Additional resources or files used in the project, if any.

## ðŸ“ˆ My Progress
Each day, I will update this section with the projects I've completed, detailing the day, project name, and a brief description. 

_I found myself finishing some of my projects faster than I expected and ended up doing a few in the same day._
