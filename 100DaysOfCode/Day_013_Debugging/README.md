# Day 13 - Debugging Practice

## Overview
Today's focus was on debugging â€“ an essential skill in programming. Instead of working on a new project, I dedicated my time to revisiting previous code and improving it by identifying and fixing bugs.

## Key Learning Points
- **Importance of Debugging:** Learned how crucial debugging is in the development process to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Techniques Used:** Applied various debugging techniques, such as reading error messages, using print statements to trace code execution, and logically thinking through the code.
- **Patience and Attention to Detail:** Debugging requires a patient approach and a keen eye for detail, which are important skills for any programmer.

## Reflections
Today's exercise was a reminder that writing code is just part of the process. The ability to read, understand, and debug existing code is equally important. This practice not only helped me improve my existing projects but also reinforced my problem-solving skills.
