#### Snake Game ####

Breaking down the snake game. As I updated on the previous commit. I changed my direction and 
focus when it comes to programming and in my opinion this is what I will spend the most time doing
instead of writing code. I feel like it will be a better way to use my time.

# Main things to complete (overview):

1. We need to move the snake 
2. Make sure to add food to the field 
3. Create a boundary the size of the screen

# Subtasks (these are smaller tasks to complete): 

1. If the head hits the body it should end game
2. If you eat a piece of food it should add length to the snake
3. Add key-presses to set the direction of the snake
4. Check to see if you are near the snake food and decide when it adds it to the tail
5. Make the food dissapear 

# How to complete this while using OOP: 

1. create a snake class 
2. create a food class
3. combine both in main
