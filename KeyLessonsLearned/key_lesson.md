### December 15, 2023 - The Essence of Problem-Solving in Programming

Today, I gained an important insight into what truly elevates a programmer: it's not just about the ability to write code or format it correctly, but rather the capacity to solve problems. This realization shifted my focus and approach towards programming.

#### Highlights:
- **Problem Solving as a Core Skill:** The most crucial leverage skill for a programmer is the ability to solve problems. It's this skill that underpins all successful coding endeavors. 
- **Active Practice and Application:** Through active practice and working on various projects, including the coding challenge I am undertaking, I am honing this vital skill.
- **Beyond Code:** Understanding that the ultimate goal is to become an expert problem solver, irrespective of the programming language or the technology used.
- **Learning Focus:** This insight has reframed my learning journey. Instead of merely focusing on syntax and language features, I am now more geared towards developing robust problem-solving abilities.

#### Additional Reflection:
- **Embracing Imperfection in Knowledge:** It's a common desire to keep programming, practicing, and learning every detail. However, the truth is that the perfect, all-knowing programmer doesn't exist. 
- **Personal Experience in Education:** Reflecting on my own journey through college, where I completed a bachelor's and a master's in electrical and computer engineering, I realized this. I observed that some of the highest-achieving students, those with 4.0 GPAs, didn't know everything. Yet, they excelled by mastering the art of problem-solving.
- **Technique Over Complete Knowledge:** These top students, and myself included, used techniques focused not on knowing everything but on being able to solve almost any problem. This approach hinges on understanding how to solve problems in the first place.

This lesson is a cornerstone in my development as a programmer and will guide my future learning and projects.

#### Why/How This Approach Works: 
- **Emphasis on Problem-Solving:** Focusing on problem-solving skills rather than trying to memorize or understand every detail is highly practical, especially in programming. This field is so vast and constantly evolving that it's impossible to know everything. The ability to approach and solve a variety of problems is far more valuable.
- **Lifelong Learning:** Approach aligns well with the concept of lifelong learning. In technology and engineering, new tools and paradigms emerge regularly. Being open to continual learning and having the skill to tackle new problems as they arise is crucial.
- **Real-World Application:** This learning technique is not just about theoretical knowledge; itâ€™s about applying what you know to real-world situations. This is often where true understanding and innovation occur.
- **Building Confidence and Adaptability:** By focusing on problem-solving, you also develop confidence in your ability to handle unknowns and challenges. This adaptability is a key asset in any professional field.
- **Collaborative Learning:** Focuses on the importance of learning from others, by observing high-achieving students/professionals. Collaborative learning and sharing problem-solving strategies can enhance understanding and skill development.
- **Balancing Depth and Breadth:** While problem-solving is crucial, it's also important to have a solid foundation in the basics of your field. A balance between depth in key areas and breadth of general knowledge often yields the best results.
